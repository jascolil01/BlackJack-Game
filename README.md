# BlackJack-Game

This is the repository for my project, I decided to make a black jack game because I have always liked the game of black jack. There is a trello for my thought process and I will be using VSCode to do all the programming

[Here is the game](https://black-jackgame.surge.sh/)

# About the Game

This game will be about Black Jack!! It will have the features of playing against a computer to see who can get closest to 21! If you go over 21 it is a bust! If you get dealt 21 you win!

# How the game will be built

My approach to the game will be through event listeners for button clicks, Math.random() to shuffle cards, variables for the cards themselves, and compare functions I made to determine who wins the game. I will be grabbing photos on the internet for card backs and other things and making sure I credit them since I do not have that kind of MS paint talent.
