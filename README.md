# BlackJack-Game

this is the repository for my project, i decided to make a black jack game, there is a trello for my thought process i will be using VSCode to do all the programming

# About the Game

This game will be about Black Jack!! it will have the features of palying against a computer to see who can get closest to 21! if you go over 21 it is a bust! if you get dealt 21 you win!

# How the game will be built

my approach to the game will be through event listeners for button clicks, math.random for the ai to deal cards, variables for the cards themselves, i will be grabbing photos offline for card backs and card tables and making sure I credit them since I do not have that kind of MS paint talent.
